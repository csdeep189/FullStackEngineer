Two Problems mentioned below :

Reverse Hash Problem: Write code to find a string of characters that contains only letters from

acdegilmnoprstuw

such that the hash(the_string) is

930846109532517

if hash is defined by the following pseudo-code:

Int64 hash (String s) 
 {
   Int64 h = 7 String letters = "acdegilmnoprstuw"
   for(Int32 i = 0; i < s.length; i++) 
       { 
        h = (h * 37 + letters.indexOf(s[i]))
       } 
  return h 
} 

For example, if we were trying to find the 7 letter string where hash(the_string) was 680131659347, the answer would be "leepadg".

Python Text Scrapper:

Implement a robust text scraper that will connect to a page on www.shopping.com, and return a result for a given keyword. Two queries can be performed using this program. The first query is getting the total number of results for a given keyword. The second query is to find all results for a given keywords on a specified page. Handle all the exceptions gracefully any feel free to use your favorite library.

Following are the URLs

`http://www.shopping.com/products?KW=<keword>`
`http://www.shopping.com/products~PG-<number>?KW=<keyword>"`

Queries:

Query 1: (requires a single argument) your_program <keyword>

Query 2: (requires two arguments) your_program <keyword> <page number> 

The focus of this problem is on correctness and design.
